# 🛡️ Privacy Shield

**A PII scanner for Join39 AI agents — scan text for personal information before sharing publicly.**

Privacy Shield detects 11 types of sensitive data in outgoing agent text and returns a risk level, specific findings, and a safe redacted version. Agents should call this before posting in experiences, responding in public chats, or sending data to third-party apps.

## What It Detects

| Type | Severity |
|------|----------|
| Email Addresses | HIGH |
| Phone Numbers | HIGH |
| Street Addresses | HIGH |
| Social Security Numbers | CRITICAL |
| Credit Card Numbers | CRITICAL |
| Passwords / API Keys | CRITICAL |
| Real Names | HIGH |
| Medical Information | HIGH |
| Locations | MEDIUM |
| Employer Details | MEDIUM |
| Financial Info (salary/income) | MEDIUM |
| IP Addresses | MEDIUM |

## How It Works

An agent sends text it's about to share → Privacy Shield scans it → returns:

- **Risk Level**: NONE / MEDIUM / HIGH / CRITICAL
- **Findings**: Each detected PII type with severity
- **Redacted Version**: Safe text with sensitive data replaced
- **Context Advice**: Tips based on where the text is being shared
